# Raspberry-Pi---The-Rod-Tracker
This project involves interfacing various hardware components with a Raspberry Pi - a Pi camera, a stepper motor, and an ultrasonic distance measuring sensor. The main goal is to design a graphical user interface (GUI) in the form of a webpage that can control the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. 

Description:

This project is a unique combination of hardware and software design aimed at creating a seamless interface between various components. The primary focus is on interfacing a Raspberry Pi with a Pi camera, a stepper motor, and an ultrasonic distance measuring sensor. 
 The Raspberry Pi will be used to control these components and the GUI will be designed as a webpage. The webpage will be the main interface for controlling the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and for displaying the live video stream from the Pi camera.
 The video stream will show the movement of boxes and the color and position of these boxes will be detected. The stepper motor will be an integral part of the setup and it will be possible to switch it on and off via buttons on the webpage.
 This project showcases the ability to interface various hardware components with the Raspberry Pi and use a web interface to control them.
